### Key TypeScript Modifications:

- The app is using **TypeScript** (specified in the README).

Below are TypeScript-based code snippets for implementing the "Clear History" functionality on each page

#### 1. **Weather Page (Clear History)**

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Button, View, Text } from 'react-native';

// Define a type for the weather history
interface WeatherHistory {
  zipCode: string;
  temperature: string;
}

const WeatherPage: React.FC = () => {
  const [weatherHistory, setWeatherHistory] = useState<WeatherHistory[]>([]);

  const clearWeatherHistory = () => {
    setWeatherHistory([]); // Clears the weather history
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Weather History:</Text>
      {weatherHistory.length > 0 ? (
        weatherHistory.map((history, index) => (
          <Text key={index}>
            {history.zipCode}: {history.temperature}Â°F
          </Text>
        ))
      ) : (
        <Text>No weather history available.</Text>
      )}
      
      {/* Clear Button */}
      <Button title="Clear Weather History" onPress={clearWeatherHistory} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default WeatherPage;
